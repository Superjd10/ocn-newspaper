## Maps

### WIP:

- [A (Rage?)TDM map by Edde](ttps://oc.tc/forums/topics/553aa67267d5227f02003122): The map will have fall damage disabled and you'll be able to choose which spawn to go to in a portal room when you respawn.

### Finished / Published:

These maps were posted in the week from April 20th to April 26th:

#### 3CP:

- [Dristy by SheriffSoco](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553c860367d522c0f000619c): Dristy is a 3CP meant to bring a new style to KotH and other CPs. Like most CPs, the capping is sequential and the goal is to have all three points in your possession. The map is styled like a DTM and the points are quite the same. The center point has a 20 second cap, and does go to an uncapped stage. The other points have a 60 second cap, also going through the uncapped stage.

#### Blitz

#### CTF:

- [Jungle's Scourge by Z3R0](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553971cdc29635818a0018b3): A CTF with block placement, highly explosive chemicals, and DTC-esq gameplay. This was made for public matches but was made with tournaments in mind and could be converted with minor changes if needed.

[![map](http://i.imgur.com/nKVtV4p.png)](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553971cdc29635818a0018b3)

- [Neyud by Qixit](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5539f52fc29635308700243a): Neyud is quite a small map with two identical sides, also its CTF. There is only 1 flag which is situated in the middle of the map. Each team needs to capture it and return it back to their castle in order to score a point. For a team to win they must capture and return the flag 8 times.

#### CTW:

- [Agrostid by matic0basle and rockymine](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553d3ae5c29635217000800f): Agrostid is a two wool per team CTW map with natural looks made by matic0basle and rockymine. Each team can hold 12 players with 14 players including premium overstack.

[![map](http://i.imgur.com/EaX3LRn.jpg)](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553d3ae5c29635217000800f)

- [Cyril by NixaniaXi and LArrowHead](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5536db1cc296353e0400010d): This is a pretty unique map in layout terms, right out of spawn it splits defenders and offenders. There is only one wool. You can only bridge between the cobwebs in the lanes. There is also an arrow spawner. There is a 3x4 block of wool in the wool room that will regenerate. Players must break the wool to obtain it. The iron above the spawn will also regenerate.

[![map](http://i.imgur.com/l5WpAWp.png)](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5536db1cc296353e0400010d)

- [Point Blank by AMo (now by DoomRobotBoy)](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553a85e167d522c0f0002a07): The main dynamic of the map is TNT. It spawns in a Boom-style lane in the middle of the map that both teams can collect. The TNT-spawning lane cannot be used to access the opponent's side; instead, one must bridge above the TNT lane or along the sides inside of the cobwebs.

[![map](http://i.imgur.com/0KTV6Ly.png)](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553a85e167d522c0f0002a07)

#### DTC / DTM:

- [Crippled Divide by LArrowHead and Rasta_Jol](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553c0c7c67d5221b670053f6): This is a two team DTM/C Map called Crippled Divide. Each team spawns on the very top of the mountain with the same objectives and spawn kits. They each have a gap to bridge across to get to the other side and destroy these objectives. The gap consists of several "platforms" that you can get on. Also, the water is a few blocks deep, so it is possible to survive if you fall into it. Each team has 32 players!

[![map](http://imgur.com/xrjgbYv.png)](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553c0c7c67d5221b670053f6)

- [Lesenct by Zintenka](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553bdaa067d522f1b6004601): A map with heavy terraforming and beauty. You will love the scenery as well as the gameplay.

[![map](http://i.imgur.com/3UpJElB.png)](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553bdaa067d522f1b6004601)

#### KotH

- [Conquering Almuji by MeMyselfAndFrog and PBnJelly](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553e51765f35b9001100991f): It has 1 hill and scorebox on each side, there is also a hill in the center of the map. It is 20 vs 20 overfill. I hope you guys enjoy it!

[![map](http://i.imgur.com/yMbqW2V.png)](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553e51765f35b9001100991f)

- [King of the Castle by Krooo](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5539650a5f35b9391e0014fa): This is a very different map from other KotH map. The players can choose out of 4 different kits. than they spawn in one of the two spawns. The objective of a team is to control the castle. Players can break blocks, make cannons, skybrdiges over the castle walls, and there are 4 well tested and balanced kits.

[![map](http://i.imgur.com/Ncn8PYu.jpg)](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5539650a5f35b9391e0014fa)

#### Rage:

- [King Cube by AtlasGames](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553ac7fe5f35b900110038ef): Join forces with either the Purple King or Green King cubes and fight to the death!

[![map](http://i.imgur.com/gQRDzo9.png)](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553ac7fe5f35b900110038ef)

- [Pyradic by Anthonny](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5536d1ea5f35b94ec4004e7a): Name tags are not visible, you can't even see your teammate's name tags. This is to make the map more surprising and suspenseful! Throughout the map you can find secret passages, back doors, and some silly Easter Eggs.

[![map](http://i.imgur.com/3piuKy3.png)](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5536d1ea5f35b94ec4004e7a)

#### TDM:

- [Flourish by rockymine](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553d1f5067d522f1b600662f): Flourish is a small map with four equal sides. There will be four teams (each 6-8 players) fighting for the most points, each kill will give you one point, the team with the most points after 8 minutes will win the game. I've added a good mix between close sword-combat and bow-combat.

- [The Towers by Quijx, Superjd10 and Fantasma1997](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553bcbbac296354c0e0048e4): A TDM map by Superjd10, Quijx and Fantasma1997. Edited with the permission and the help of Quijx. The original [The Towers](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/maps/2227385-the-towers-team-based-pvp-map).

## Rotations:

[Broken is now CTF! (read below)](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/Rotations/commit/2389c8d89f20035bef79dd92937c92999f8008b8)


## Official Announcements:

- [Capture the Flag official release](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5536d97167d5226848000129):

Capture the Flag has been publicly playable for a while now, and is at a pretty good place in terms of gameplay and stability, so we thought it was time to release it officially. Besides the server being renamed to CTF, there are no changes at this particular moment, but there is still plenty of map and code development going on.


## Suggestions: 

- ["Can we just try this for like a week?" by Edde](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5535426a67d522a887001be5): Basically, remove the ability to choose teams for donors. I would like to see how this would work out for a week and the reactions that it might cause.

- ["I think we need to catch up" by xtrem](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5539be9d67d522b27100202b): Our friends over at the avic.us server have set up a system for scrimmages. Its a relatively simple system where you reserve a slot to use a scrimmage server. It's not necessarily the most efficient system possible, but its something

- ["Add tips that show people how to defend" by Tapetepato](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553b9e6d67d5226946004236): Right now we need more defenders, since a lot of games get rushed. There's usually little to no defenders on every match, and one of the many problems with the lack of defenses being made is that people don't know how to make them.

- ["Force Rerating" by Elijah](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553b912e5f35b9532d004527): Currently, the rating system assumes 2 things: that your judgement of a maps quality is complete after a certain (short) amount of playing it, and that this judgement will never change. Clearly neither of these assumptions hold much water, so what can we do to address them?

- ["Community Assistants" by matic0basle](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553a37a95f35b9de0b002a97): This is a rank that I think is highly needed on Overcast. We have a community administrator that is kind of inactive. While other staff members are good at interacting with the community you can still notice a decent sized lack of interaction between the staff team and others in the community. This rank will hopefuly solve that at least to some point.

- ["/report visibility" by H2giulio](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553e79bdc29635c1bf009b4e): Why not make /report messages public? Or at least viewable by some players that are competent on the matter?

- ["Staff System Changes" by Cratain - Sc0pE_H3ad](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5539cea067d5225a3f001a48).

- ["Search button / Botón de búsqueda" by Sycronk](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553d7e9cc296352a5f0089df): 

![map](http://i.imgur.com/sORYLAa.png?1)

- ["More variety in servers" by Fabio_](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553d715667d522817d009287): The Overcast Network offers variety in gamemodes, maps, strats, and all; but they haven't exploided it as how it should, to make our community bigger AND more enjoyable.

- ["A criticism of the server, the community and also ourselves" by felipu_feliu](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553991635f35b9de0b001e23): We all know that OCN is with much less people than in 2012-2013, and we need to change that and we can't wait to the staff to do it for us, OCN is a server with a lot more of varity than Kohi or so many others servers would not give it to you, but why we don't have that much people like in others servers? that's because of a lot of things, so for that I made this thread to criticize the community, the staff and also myself.

- ["Removing most Private Rooms in Mumble" by ItzaMeLuigi](https://oc.tc/forums/topics/553c57515f35b9dceb005c6d): Mumble is supposed to be a community platform where you can talk to people on the server. Now it's a place full of cliques while other members have no one to talk to and feel left out.
